# AI/ML

AI/ML—short for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)—represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing that is quickly transforming a vast array of industries.Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.

# Task: Create webapp using Streamlit
## Overview
Streamlit is a framework used to build webapps with python. You have to create a webapp that has a navigation menu containing two sub-items: image and video. Each of the sections should have options to either select a local file or use the camera to capture the image/video. The selected file should then be displayed with a caption (for this, a textbox should be provided for taking input).

## Requirements
* The project must be hosted (in streamlit) and marked as `public`
* Menus for 'image' and 'video' should be implemented.
* Repo must contain a `requirements.txt` file. To create, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and filter out any non-required dependencies.


## Evaluation
The notebook evaluation will be based on:
* How well the code is documented
* How optimised the requirements.txt file is
* The overall execution of the code


# Deadline
Please submit your completed work by 13th April 11:59 PM IST.
